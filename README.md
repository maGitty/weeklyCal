weekly_cal
==========
__________

This project provides scripts to create a week planer via LaTeX for students. The year of the summer term and the first monday have to be specified respectively.

Additionally, a pdf document can be used to provide a graphical title page.

The document can be folded up accordingly to be printed as A5/A6 using the week\_cal\_1x2.tex and week\_cal\_2x2.tex respectively.
